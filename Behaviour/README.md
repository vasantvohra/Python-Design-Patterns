# Behaviour Design patterns
- These patterns are concerned with **algorithms** and the assignment of **responsibilities** between objects.

Examples
- Observer Pattern
  - Establish a one-to-many relationship between a subject and multiple observers
  - Problem: A subject being monitored, observers are notified when there is change in subject.
  - Scenario: Keeping a track of core temperature of nuclear reactors in a power plant. If there is a change in a core temperature registered observers must be notified.
- Visitor - allows adding new features to the existing class hierarchy without changing it
- Iterator
- Strategy
- Chain of Responsibility
