# Behaviour Design patterns
- These patterns are concerned with the **algorithms** and assignment of **responsibilities** between objects.

Examples
- Observer Pattern
  - Establish a one-to-many relationship between a subject and multiple observers
  - Problem: A subject being monitored, observers are notified when there is a change in subject.
  - Scenario: Keeping a track of core temperature of nuclear reactors in a power plant. 
  If there is a change in a core temperature registered observers must be notified.
- Visitor 
  - Allows adding new features to the existing class hierarchy without changing it.
- Iterator
  - Provides sequential access to the elements of a collection
- Strategy 
- Chain of Responsibility
